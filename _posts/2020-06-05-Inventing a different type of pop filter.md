Got a stanky, old crusty nylon pop filter? 
Notice voice alterations when it gets soaked after you've spit or sing fire bars?

I got something straight from the aquarium 
that couldn't get wet even if your girl was in the room with you, on a date night...

We'll start off with the lesson and then go into the DIY Pop filter - The Tear Drop 101

## The lesson - taken from the book "Steal Like an Artist"

1.Steal like an artist.

2.Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started.

3.Write the book you want to read.

4.Use your hands.

5.Side projects and hobbies are important.

6.The secret: do good work and share it with people.

7.Geography is no longer our master.

8.Be nice. (The world is a small town.)

9.Be boring. (It’s the only way to get work done.)

10.Creativity is subtraction.
