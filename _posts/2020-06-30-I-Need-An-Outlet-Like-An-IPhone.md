## I REALLY NEED AN OUTLET... [:]

Definitions:

Girly face = a cute ass woman whom a guy flirts with, AND totally sees themselves on 51st dates with her!

Boy face = what a girly face calls a boy she likes

## WHERE DO I START?

I sit here in a white tee, my “X marks the Spot” cap and “Kylie Jenner” colored Sauconys (Low Pro Jazz), taking in the aroma of pine, and chillin’ with my adult sippy cup on a windy day.  To add to it all, I’m quite perturbed, I can’t decipher if Mother Nature is trying to play peek-a-boo with skirts and panties or sending me a sign to work on my rap music marketing, with a Windy/Wendy Day…  [(Cole, no, I did not take your line, good sir!)](https://colemizestudios.com/category/how-to-rap-better/)

## CURRENT MENTAL STATE OF THE UNION 

I thought this blog would be that OUTLET where I shop my ideas, throw open passes and/or shamelessly plug myself - my thoughts are not absolute at the moment, like I told my friends, the only things absolut(e) in life are Vodka and death.  At this moment, literally, while I sit and write this at my community picnic table, I’ve reconsidered in telling you how, A.“I’ve either been enlightened or B. presented with harsh reality”.  Shit, we’re all presented harsh realities every day, it’s the ones who wipe their own asses who will make it out.  Figuratively or literally, you choose, but if you reference Donald Trump, then know he’s currently using The United States of America as his outhouse, and there’s not a damn sheet of toilet paper in sight.

Perhaps in November, we’ll get to clean house and refill the toilet paper retainers with Charmin.  Heck, I’ll take Charmin-soft-Biden over shit-everywhere-Trump…   Ah stop right there, I’m not getting into politics.  I’m simply making observations of two white men, one in the white house, and the other riding his electric scooter up and down 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, BIDING time (pun intended) until November 2020.

## BACK TO NATURE

Alright, let’s pull back into our senses, sit back down at our nearby picnic table and sip on lemonade…  It’s been a toasty Spring/Summer thus far, wouldn’t you agree?  Heck, near the middle of April 2020 I was released from my office job, and I was thinking to myself,” When offices open back up, who’s going to air condition my nether regions?” - my sweaty balls concurred.  Segue (no scooter) - why do girly faces always complain about sweaty balls?  I mean, the smell is akin to damp muskrats, nothing a warm soapy shower can’t fix.  I don’t see an issue, hmm, maybe I should shower more - a damp muskrat in fresh underoos, is still a damp muskrat :(

I've been a bit confused in this heat...

Whoops wrong underoos...

There that's a bit more acurate...

How’s my Summer been you ask?  Oh it’s been lovely, I walk around in white tees and those thin cloth shorts, you know the ones where it appears to be a pendulum swinging out front… Ladies, not sure you can relate.   Back to the white tees, as a kid growing up (you know cuz that’s the main thing you do as a kid (grow up)) I always wondered why rappers mostly wore white tees.  From my quick Google search I can see there was a gang in Chicago that wore simple white tees dating back to 2004-2005, but that’s not the topic here - Nothing on the topic of rappers, perhaps my Google search wasn’t deep enough.  My personal reasoning for wearing white tee shirts, I feel, if you don’t look/feel good in representing yourself in a white tee shirt, then there’s more work to do.  With optimism, achy mid-thirty old joints and a chubby kid’s smile, I confess, I do have a lot more work to do.  Hey every gym has an ice cream parlor next door, right?  Or does that situation mainly apply to home gyms?  Either way, how has your Summer been?

## AS THE WORLD TURNS

Think of our lives Before Covid-19 hit… We were going to ask that girly face or that boy face out,  we were going to apply to in-person acting jobs or leave that soul-sucking career, we, collectively, were going to do an X-ton this year!  Personally, I had just completed acting-on-camera, voice-over classes and released my Nerdy Girls collab single. I was transitioning myself out of the Information Technology field, Covid-19 happened to give me a HUGE push, and with that same force told me to,”Do it all online!”  I feel millions of artists at varying stages of their careers can relate.  I’m sure this next thing is not unique to me, but I happened to gain 11lbs (opposite of muscle) and am feeling the daily wear and tear on my joints.  

See, prior to Covid-19 I’d swim almost daily to keep the weight down and stay agile and mobile with practically zero impact on my joints.  I haven’t swam in almost 4 months and this water animal is thirsty, and I’m not speaking of the drip variety.  Similar to my aspirations as a kid, I simply want to make a splash, I could say the ambition is directed towards both creative pursuits and the literal swimming pool, equally, however, during Summer of 2020, I simply want to swim where the water’s cold, both literally and figuratively.  And the cold water in my life currently is on-camera and voice-over.  

## ON THE PLAYGROUND

With that said, I am currently working on a playful collaboration platform called “On The Playground” it’s a mix between podcasting and game streaming - see the logo below.

There’s a lot more format testing currently being done. If you like to play and chat about gaming and have an active social media account, (even if you think it’s small) and interested in being a tester (as a tester and co-host/guest, you’ll get to practice and showcase your improv, acting both on-camera and voice-over), either hit me up on one of the socials, email or my text number on the “about” page.

Just think about it, we could play a mystery or puzzle game like [THE ROOM](https://www.fireproofgames.com/games/the-room) together all while growing wrinkles in our brains, or we could shiver and shriek across the internet with one or more viewers watching us playing a horror game which rivals a good horror movie.  Alternatively, we could play some online scrabble or simply do some voice-over work on a game which only has subtitles, and imbue the characters with life :) Hey I'm throwing this one out here, I just picked up those fishing games and those across the USA trucker games, just think we could present Afternoon Fishing On the Playground With "Awesome Human" and DeBarros, or "Strap in for a semi-truck road trip across Colorado and Idaho, mother-truckers!"

These last 2-3 months, I’ve been laying the groundwork for a more meaningful, inclusive, online presence and have been thinking deep on, “How I can build a playful platform.  I’m experimenting and playing like we used to do no the playground as kids, I’ll be sure to keep you updated right cheerrr in this dern blog, arrr k :)

Check the practice I did with Mario, earlier in the day (demo of OTP, only 50 seconds):

 I’ll keep using this blog as an outlet - we can’t have too many outlets… right?
 
 Oh - by the way, I really do need an outlet... I'm sitting in the park with no outlet, or am I?
