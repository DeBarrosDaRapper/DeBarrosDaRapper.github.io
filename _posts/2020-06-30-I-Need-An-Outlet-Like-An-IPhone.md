## I really need an outlet... [:]

Definitions:

Girly face = a cute ass woman whom a guy flirts with, AND totally sees themselves on 51st dates with her!

Boy face = what a girly face calls a boy she likes

## Where do I start?

I sit here in a white tee, my “X marks the Spot” cap and “Kylie Jenner” colored Sauconys (Low Pro Jazz), taking in the aroma of pine, and chillin’ with my adult sippy cup on a windy day.  To add to it all, I’m quite perturbed, I can’t decipher if Mother Nature is trying to play peek-a-boo with skirts and panties or sending me a sign to work on my rap music marketing, with a Windy/Wendy Day…  [(Cole, no, I did not take your line, good sir!)](https://colemizestudios.com/category/how-to-rap-better/)

## Current mental state of the union 

I thought this blog would be that OUTLET where I shop my ideas, throw open passes and/or shamelessly plug myself - my thoughts are not absolute at the moment, like I told my friends, the only things absolut(e) in life are Vodka and death.  At this moment, literally, while I sit and write this at my community picnic table, I’ve reconsidered in telling you how, A.“I’ve either been enlightened or B. presented with harsh reality”.  Shit, we’re all presented harsh realities every day, it’s the ones who wipe their own asses who will make it out.  Figuratively or literally, you choose, but if you reference Donald Trump, then know he’s currently using The United States of America as his outhouse, and there’s not a damn sheet of toilet paper in sight.

Perhaps in November, we’ll get to clean house and refill the toilet paper retainers with Charmin.  Heck, I’ll take Charmin-soft-Biden over shit-everywhere-Trump…   Ah stop right there, I’m not getting into politics.  I’m simply making observations of two white men, one in the white house, and the other riding his electric scooter up and down 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, BIDING time (pun intended) until November 2020.

## Back to nature

Alright, let’s pull back into our senses, sit back down at our nearby picnic table and sip on lemonade…  It’s been a toasty Spring/Summer thus far, wouldn’t you agree?  Heck, near the middle of April 2020 I was released from my office job, and I was thinking to myself,” When offices open back up, who’s going to air condition my nether regions?” - my sweaty balls concurred.  Segue (no scooter) - why do girly faces always complain about sweaty balls?  I mean, the smell is akin to damp muskrats, nothing a warm soapy shower can’t fix.  I don’t see an issue, hmm, maybe I should shower more - a damp muskrat in fresh underoos, is still a damp muskrat :(
