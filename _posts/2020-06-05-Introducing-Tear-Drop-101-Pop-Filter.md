# Are you a DIY recording artist in need of a better pop filter?

I so happen to be revisiting the book 
## "Steal Like an Artist"
and thought I'd share how I didn't reinvent the wheel I simply came up with a different version of the "wheel"

I'll give you the 10 Big Ideas straight away

1.Steal like an artist.

2.Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started.

3.Write the book you want to read.

4.Use your hands.

5.Side projects and hobbies are important.

6.The secret: do good work and share it with people.

7.Geography is no longer our master.

8.Be nice. (The world is a small town.)

9.Be boring. (It’s the only way to get work done.)

10.Creativity is subtraction.
